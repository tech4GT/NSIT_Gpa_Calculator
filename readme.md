# GPA Calculator

This is a simple application for calculating GPAs right from PDF Transcripts from IMS NSIT.

This project has been hard coded to work with 7 semesters only.

Deployed at [https://getmynsitgpa.netlify.app](https://getmynsitgpa.netlify.app)

You can install the command line utility by installing it globally and then using the command `getmygpa`

```bash
npm i -g ./command_line_app
getmygpa <Path to the pdf transcripts>
```

<b>This will not work if you have an sgpa of 10 in any of your semesters. Mostly because if you put in enough work to get a perfect 10, put in some more and calculate your GPA yourself.
