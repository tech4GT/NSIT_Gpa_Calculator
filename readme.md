# GPA Calculator

This is a simple application for calculating GPAs right from PDF Transcripts from IMS NSIT. It'll automatically detect the number of semesters you have completed and spit out your GPA.

The project works only with NSIT DU transcripts as of now.

Deployed at [https://getmynsitgpa.netlify.app](https://getmynsitgpa.netlify.app)

You can install the command line utility by installing it globally and then using the command `getmynsitgpa`

```bash
npm i -g ./command_line_app
getmynsitgpa <Path to the pdf transcripts>
```

<b>This will not work if you have an sgpa of 10 in any of your semesters. Mostly because if you put in enough work to get a perfect 10, put in some more and calculate your GPA yourself. :)
